# php-java-bridge

*Unofficial* github repository for the [PHP/Java bridge](http://php-java-bridge.sourceforge.net/pjb/).

## Introduction

Fork of the official sourceforge [CVS PHP/Java bridge repository](https://sourceforge.net/p/php-java-bridge/code/) migrated
to git (from latest release 6.2.1).

This unofficial fork has been created to facilitate the development of

- [soluble-japha](https://github.com/belgattitude/soluble-japha)
- [pjbserver-tools](https://github.com/belgattitude/pjbserver-tools)


You can have a look to the [official readme](./README) or to
the [official project page](https://sourceforge.net/p/php-java-bridge/code/) to get more information.

## Motivations

- Migration from CSV to Git
- Cleanup of obsolete version (start at 6.2.1)

## Future

- Modernize documentation
- Provide a maven repo
